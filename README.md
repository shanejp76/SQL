# SQL
This Achievement challenged me to "learn by doing" SQL as a beginner. The fictitious movie-streaming business "Rockbuster Stealth" required that I:
  * wrote moderately complex SQL queries to answer business questions
  * presented results to technical & non-technical colleagues

Folders are organized by file type. 
> 1. "Preliminary Files" are answers to assignment questions that lead up to the final project.
> 2. "Final Project" contains my data dictionary and an Excel document communicating my findings to a technical colleague.
> 3. "SQL Tasks.zip" is all project components available for further exploration
