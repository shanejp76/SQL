---- Non-Uniform Data

-- Examine the data for each variable:
SELECT DISTINCT rating
FROM film;

-- If there are inconsistencies, consolidate using:
UPDATE film
SET rating = ‘G’
WHERE rating IN(‘general, ‘g’, ‘General’);


---- Duplicate data

-- Identify duplicates:
SELECT film_id, count(*)
FROM film
GROUP BY film_id
HAVING COUNT(*)>1;

-- If you find duplicates, create a view:
CREATE VIEW film_id_duplicates AS
SELECT film_id
FROM film
GROUP BY film_id;

-- Delete the duplicates:
DELETE
FROM film
WHERE unique_id NOT IN (SELECT MIN(unique_id)
FROM film
GROUP BY film);
